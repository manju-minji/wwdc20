func play(){

        var count = 0

        while count < 3{
               
               //statement
               
               count = count + 1
        }
}

//After first loop -> count = 1

//After second loop -> count = 2

//After third loop -> count = 3

-> The repetition ends because it does not meet count  < 3.

//So, in the end, the statement is repeated three times.
